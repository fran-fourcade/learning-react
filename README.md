# Welcome to my React Learning Journey

## 📝 About This Project

This repository contains my personal notes and examples as I work through the [React official documentation](https://react.dev/). While it starts simple, I plan to continuously enhance it with:

- More detailed explanations and examples
- Improved styling and UI components
- Additional React concepts and patterns
- Best practices and common pitfalls

## 📚 Current Content

- **Props**: Understanding component communication and data flow
- **State**: Managing component-specific memory with useState
- **Events**: Handling user interactions in React

This is just the beginning! More topics will be added as I continue learning.
